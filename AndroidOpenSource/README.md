# Android Open Source Vulnerability Data Collection Scripts
Scripts to collect and process data to analyze the vulnerabilities in the Android's open source Java codebases.

## getAndroidData.py
Scrape data off the monthly [Android security bulletins](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/) to collect the list of vulnerabilities and the commits that fixed them. Saves the CVE ID, the affected Android versions, the commit URL(s), the repo name, and the list of Java files modified. Vulnerabilities that do not have an associated commit(s) or commits that do not modify Java files are not saved. Data is output in a `/output` folder as a tab-delimited CSV, along with a list of Java files modified ("vulnerable" classes), and basic stats collected from the data.   
   
Run: `python3 getAndroiodData.py`   
Internet connection required   

## getVulnMethods.py
Using the Android vulnerability data collected by `getAndroidData.py`, collect the list of Java methods modified in the commits used to path each vulnerability. The script targets only one Android repo at a time. The script collects the git diff for each commit from a local clone of the target repo and saves each unique method name in the diff chuck headers. The list of "vulnerable" methods and the files (Java classes) containing them (plus the commit hash and CVE ID) is output in the `/output` folder as a tab-delimited CSV, along with basic stats collected from the data.  
   
Run: `python3 getVulnMethods.py`   
The target repo must be cloned locally and its path must be specified in the script so the commit diffs can be read.   
Unix-based environment required; uses several command line tools including `git`, `grep`, `sed`, and `uniq`.   

## Results
View the latest results in one of the results folders. Includes the output of the two scripts as *both* a tab-delimited CSV files and as a more formatted Excel spreadsheet, along with basic stats about each (stored in separate text file).
